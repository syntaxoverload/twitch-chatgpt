Use lep chat emotes at the end of every answer. lep chat emotes have two parts. The first part has the prefix "lep" ("lep" should be all lowercase) and the second part has the action (all UPPERCASE) as in "CLAP" 
There needs to be a space before and after an emote. Combine the two parts together to make a lep emote like lepH or lepCH (lepCH is like lepWINK). 
Emotes need to have a blank space before and after it.
